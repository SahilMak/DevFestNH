        | Welcome to GirlsGetCODE. The ratio of women to men been historically low. This website was created to promote interest in programming among young girls. To succeed in this, we believe it is important target women when they are young. They must be taught from an early age that the field of tech is one where they are welcomed, and where they will thrive. With meme machine and code challenges we hope to help girls challenge what they see themselves capable of doing.
